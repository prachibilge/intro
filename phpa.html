    We already have discussed about variables and global variables in PHP in the post PHP | Variables and Data Types. In this article, we will learn about superglobals in PHP.

These are specially-defined array variables in PHP that make it easy for you to get information 
about a request or its context. The superglobals are available throughout your script. These variables can be accessed from any function, class or any file without doing any special task such as declaring any global variable etc.
 They are mainly used to store and get information from one page to another etc in an application.

    <h2>Below is the list of superglobal variables available in PHP:</p></h2><br> 

1.$GLOBALS<br>
2.$_SERVER<br>
3.$_REQUEST<br>
4.$_GET<br>
5.$_POST<br>
6.$_SESSION<br>
7.$_COOKIE<br>
8.$_FILES<br>
9.$_ENV<br>

    In this article, we will know what HTTP GET and POST methods are in PHP, how to implement these HTTP methods & their usage, by understanding them through the examples.

HTTP: The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is designed to enable communications between clients and servers. HTTP works as a request-response protocol between a client and server. A web browser may be the client, and an application on a computer that hosts a website may be the server. A client (browser) submits an HTTP request to the server; then the server returns a response to the client. The response contains status information about the request and may also contain the requested content.

There are 2 HTTP request methods:

GET: Requests data from a specified resource.
POST: Submits data to be processed to a specified resource.

<p><h2>PHP | Regular Expressions</h2><br>
    Regular expressions commonly known as a regex (regexes) are a sequence of characters describing a special search pattern in the form of text string. They are basically used in programming world algorithms for matching some loosely defined patterns to achieve some relevant tasks. Some times regexes are understood as a mini programming language with a pattern notation which allows the users to parse text strings. The exact sequence of characters are unpredictable beforehand, so the regex helps in fetching the required strings based on a pattern definition.

    Regular Expression is a compact way of describing a string pattern that matches a particular amount of text. As you know, PHP is an open-source language commonly used for website creation, it provides regular expression functions as an important tool. Like PHP, many other programming languages have their own implementation of regular expressions. This is the same with other applications also, which have their own support of regexes having various syntaxes. Many available modern languages and tools apply regexes on very large files and strings. Let us look into some of the advantages and uses of regular expressions in our applications.<br>
    
    <h2>Advantages and uses of Regular expressions:</h2>
    In many scenarios, developers face problems whenever data are collected in free text fields as most of the programming deals with data entries. Regular expressions are used almost everywhere in today’s application programming.
    
    Regular expressions help in validation of text strings which are of programmer’s interest.<br>
    It offers a powerful tool for analyzing, searching a pattern and modifying the text data.<br>
    It helps in searching specific string pattern and extracting matching results in a flexible manner.<br>
    It helps in parsing text files looking for a defined sequence of characters for further analysis or data manipulation.<br>
    With the help of in-built regexes functions, easy and simple solutions are provided for identifying patterns.<br>
    It effectively saves a lot of development time, which are in search of specific string pattern.<br>
    It helps in important user information validations like email address, phone numbers and IP address.<br>
    It helps in highlighting special keywords in a file based on search result or input.<br>
    It helps in identifying specific template tags and replacing those data with the actual data as per the requirement.<br>
    Regexes are very useful for creation of HTML template system recognizing tags.<br>
    Regexes are mostly used for browser detection, spam filtration, checking password strength and form validations.<br>
    We cannot cover everything under this topic, but let us look into some of the major regular expression concepts. <br>
