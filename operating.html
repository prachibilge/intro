    <p>An Operating System(OS) is software that manages and handles the hardware and software resources of 
        a computer system. It provides interaction between users of computers and computer hardware. 
        An operating system is responsible for managing and controlling all the activities and sharing of computer
         resources. An operating system is a low-level Software that includes all the basic functions like processor
          management, memory management, Error detection, etc.

        This Operating System tutorial will cover all the basic to advance operating system
         concepts like System Structure, CPU Scheduling, Deadlock, file and disk management, and many more.</p>
         <p><h2> Purposes and Tasks of Operating Systems</h2>
            Several tasks are performed by the Operating Systems and it also helps in serving a lot of purposes
             which are mentioned below. We will see how Operating System helps us in serving in a better way with the help of the task performed by it.
            
            <h2>Purposes of an Operating System</h2>
           1. It controls the allocation and use of the computing Systemâ€™s resources among the various user and tasks.
           2. It provides an interface between the computer hardware and the programmer that
            simplifies and makes it feasible for coding and debugging of application programs.</p>
