        <p><center>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard markup language used to create web pages. 
            HTML is a combination of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext defines the link between web pages.
             A markup language is used to define the text document within the tag to define the structure of web pages.<br>

            This language is used to annotate (make notes for the computer) text so that
             a machine can understand it and manipulate text accordingly. 
             Most markup languages (e.g. HTML) are human-readable. 
             The language uses tags to define what manipulation has to be done on the text.</center></p>
