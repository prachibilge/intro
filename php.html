            The term PHP is an acronym for – Hypertext Preprocessor. PHP is a server-side scripting language designed specifically for web development. It is open-source which means it is free to download and use. It is very simple to learn and use. The file extension of PHP is “.php”. 

PHP was introduced by Rasmus Lerdorf in the first version and participated in the later versions. It is an interpreted language and it does not require a compiler. 

<h2>Characteristics of PHP</h2>
PHP code is executed in the server.<br>
It can be integrated with many databases such as Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Sybase, and Informix.<br>
It is powerful to hold a content management system like WordPress and can be used to control user access.<br>
It supports main protocols like HTTP Basic, HTTP Digest, IMAP, FTP, and others.<br>
Websites like www.facebook.com and www.yahoo.com are also built on PHP.<br>
One of the main reasons behind this is that PHP can be easily embedded in HTML files and HTML codes can also be written in a PHP file.<br>
The thing that differentiates PHP from the client-side language like HTML is, that PHP codes are executed on the server whereas HTML codes are directly rendered on the browser. <br>PHP codes are first executed on the server and then the result is returned to the browser.<br>
The only information that the client or browser knows is the result returned after executing the PHP script on the server and not the actual PHP codes present in the PHP file. Also, PHP files can support other client-side scripting languages like CSS and JavaScript.<br>

<h2>Origin and History</h2>
<p>
PHP was created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994 and initially stood for “Personal Home Page.” Over the years, it evolved into “PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.”
PHP is open-source and has a large community of developers contributing to its development.
Purpose of using PHP
PHP is primarily used for server-side web development. It enables the creation of dynamic web pages by embedding PHP code within HTML.
PHP can perform various tasks, including handling form data, generating dynamic page content, managing databases, and interacting with servers.
