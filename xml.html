        <p> <center>Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a markup language that defines a set of rules 
            for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. 
            The design goals of XML focus on simplicity, generality, and usability across the Internet.
             It is a textual data format with strong support via Unicode for different human languages.
              Although the design of XML focuses on documents, the 
            language is widely used for the representation of arbitrary data structures
             such as those used in web services.</center><br>

            <p><h2>Differences between XML and HTML</h2>
                XML and HTML were designed with different goals:<br>

                .XML is designed to carry data emphasizing on what type of data it is.<br>
                .HTML is designed to display data emphasizing on how data looks<br>
                .XML tags are not predefined like HTML tags.<br>
                .HTML is a markup language whereas XML provides a framework for defining markup languages.<br>
                .HTML is about displaying data,hence it is static whereas XML is about carrying information,which makes it dynamic.<br>
